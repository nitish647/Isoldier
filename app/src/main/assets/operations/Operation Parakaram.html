<b>	Operation Parakaram
</b><br>Operation Parakram, which means ‘valour’ was a momentous event which could have unleashed a major war on the sub-continent. It involved a massive build-up Indian Army ordered in the wake of the December 13, 2001, terrorist attack on Parliament House. This 10-month-long mobilisation from January to October 2002, along the border with Pakistan generated high levels of tension in the relations between the two South Asian neighbours, and raised the prospects of a major war. The operation was a major effort in coercive diplomacy by New Delhi, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the Indian Parliament on December 13, 2001, and while the Government claims that their strategic objectives were met by mere posturing which avoided a war, military analysts are of the view that gains were not commensurate to the mammoth exercise in coercive diplomacy by India. However, it led to some positive changes in India’s military doctrine and it hastened military modernisation together with organizational changes.
