<b>	Maldives
</b><br>On November 3, 1988, the Indian Army launched the operation in Maldives to prevent mercenaries from overthrowing the Government of Maldives and while it did not involve much fighting, it demonstrated to the World the speed and efficiency with which the Indian Armed Forces could react. This period (1989 onwards) also saw the start of the terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir and deployment of additional troops in J&K.
