<b>Steady Modernization – Period From 1971 to 1998</b>
The period after 1971 War saw the steady modernization of the Indian Army with new equipment for modern wars. The Expert Committee under the Chairmanship of Lt General K.V. Krishna Rao submitted its report in 1976. Some of its major recommendations started getting implemented in the eighties. The expansion of mechanized forces was achieved as a result of this report.
On April 13, 1984, 34 soldiers of the Indian Army were landed by 17 sorties of helicopters at a point three kilometers short of Bilafond La, a pass on the Soltaro ridge, West of Siachen glacier. The soldiers occupied the pass. This was the opening move in what is referred to as the Siachen conflict between India & Pakistan which continues till date. This period also saw the Army operation in the Golden Temple on night June 5 to 6, 1984 at Amritsar to clear the complex of the militants who had based themselves in the temple. The Operation was code named ‘Blue Star’ By the first light of June 7, 1984, the Golden Temple complex had been cleared of militants but it left, in its aftermath, a wave of anguish and anger among the Sikh community and the nation faced the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh guards.
