<b>From Trauma to Victory - Period 1961 to 1971</b>
The period 1961 to 1971 was one of the most traumatic periods of the Indian Army. The defeat in 1962 shook the foundation of the nation and the armed forces. The army began to introspect to overcome its weaknesses. The 1965 war helped the army to redeem itself but revealed embarrassing weaknesses in its equipment and its training and even leadership at various levels. These two wars spurred the political leadership to modernize and expand the services. As 1970 came to a close, the Indian Army was now ready to face new challenges emerging on the horizon.

1971 War resulted in creation of a new nation - Bangladesh and a decisive military victory in which 93,000 prisoners of war were taken. While many books have been written to describe each battle in detail, it is the spirit of the soldiery during this campaign that deserves mention. In the words of Sydney Schanberg of New York Times, who accompanied Indian troops in two sectors – ‘I don’t like sitting around praising armies. I don’t like armies because armies mean wars – and I don’t like wars. But this (the Indian) army was something..... They were great all the way. There was never a black mark…. I lived with the officers and I walked, rode with the jawans – and they were all great ... And they were the most perfect gentlemen- I have never seen them do a wrong thing – not even when they just saw how bestial the ‘enemy had been.”
